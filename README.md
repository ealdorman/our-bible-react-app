# Our Bible app

> A React.js app for Our Bible

The Our Bible front-end app, written in Typescript, is the main front-end app for [Our Bible](https://ourbible.io).

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed to run this app.

## Development

To run the app in development mode, run:

`npm run start:dev`

The app will communicate with the development version of the [Our Bible API](https://github.com/ealdorman/our-bible-api). Be sure to have that API running on your localhost.

## Production

To run the app in production, run:

`npm run start`

The app will then communicate with the production Our Bible API.
